# graphql-server

Issues:

Article I followed: https://edgecoders.com/graphql-learn-by-doing-part-2-of-3-4f02ae01d47d

When I try passing in data from the API to graphiQL, there is an error about the field name.
Looking at the wikiHow API, it looks like the attributes are just numbers which is what is giving 
an error when I put it in numbers under fields.
